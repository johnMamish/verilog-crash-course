# Verilog Crash Course

This repo contains examples that demonstrate the basic fundamentals of Verilog, as well as a few exercises for you to try out the fundamentals as you learn them.

Each numbered folder contains a short readme, examples, and exercises. To play with any example or exercise, go into the corresponding folder (e.g. `00/examples/00-and_example/`) and run `make`. `make` should give you further instructions after that.

These examples use iverilog and gtk. To install them on linux, do
    sudo apt install iverilog gtkwave

Happy hacking!
