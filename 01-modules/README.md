# Organizing things into modules

#### To improve code organization and allow for code reuse.

One of the most important skills in crafting good software is figuring out how to break things up into functions. Doing this well will make your software easier to read, easier to write, and easier to extend.

The same skill exists in hardware. Verilog, like VHDL, lets you encapsulate hardware designs as "modules". You can put together smaller modules to make bigger modules, and you can duplicate one module as many times as you like. Just as importantly, modules provide you with a powerful way to improve the readability and structure of your code.
